\title{Lumped HBV catchment data}
\format{
A data frame containing:
\describe{
  \item{Date}{date series.}
  \item{T(ÂºC)}{air temperature series.}
  \item{P(mm/d)}{total ammount of precipitation per day.}
  \item{PET(mm/d)}{potential evapotranspiration series.}
  \item{qout(mm/d)}{specific basin discharge. This are the values that you have to reproduce.}
}
}
\usage{
lumped_hbv
}
\description{
Here you will find what I consider the starting point dataset to begin the modeling with
HBV.IANIGLA. This data is for modeling the streamflow of a synthetic basin
with a perfect fit. For running the model you will have to connect the different
package's modules (or functions) in order to get what I consider
the most simple hydrological model.
