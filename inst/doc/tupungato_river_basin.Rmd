## Is your turn!

In this chapter you are by your own. In the `data("tupungato_data")` dataset you will find 
a minimal information content to simulate the streamflow discharge of the Tupungato River basin (`?tupungato_data`). 

**Hint**:
 
 * maybe is time time take a look at the [Evapotranspiration](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Evapotranspiration) 
 package. Remember that in this case example (Tupungato basin) you only have air temperature series.
 * in the dataset you will find series of snow cover area. Are they useful? how? [see @parajka_value_2008; @finger:2015].
 * to construct the HBV model it would be wise to revisit vignette's chapter 3.
